This is a partner game/site where you swipe on names for selecting baby names. 
once you have your favorites you can compare them with your partners and together get a list of names you both like.

The source data was collected from SCBs statistics of names: https://www.skatteverket.se/omoss/varverksamhet/statistikportalen/namnpanyfodda.4.7da1d2e118be03f8e4f5b9d.html#Oversikt

**Frontend behavior:**  
The overall design for this application is to have it be compatible with touch screens, 
and use a minimal ui to exclude as much needless buttons as possible and instead focus on what the user needs to have available to him/her.
- **Swipe Actions:**
  - Right: add to liked
  - Left: add to disliked
  - Up: Add to favorites
  - Down: skip
